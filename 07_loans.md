When the user clicks on a loan, they are able to see what type of loan it is — whether a Medical Emergency Loan or Business Expense Loan or otherwise — their account number of the loan, the state of the loan, the loan principal (amount borrowed), the total due amount (the amount to be repaid) and the due date for repayment of the loan.

For active loans, the user can choose to repay them by clicking on the **Pay Now** button if they have the funds ready and they do not wish to wait for the due date to make the payment.
