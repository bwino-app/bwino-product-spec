# Adding a Card

To enable automatic repayment of loans, the user may add their debit/credit card to the app. This can be done by first going to the **Account** tab and then selecting the **Cards** option.

A new user will be presented with a screen prompting them to add a new card to the system. Existing users will have the option of viewing their already existing cards and adding new cards to the system.
