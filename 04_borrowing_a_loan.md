# Borrowing a Loan

After account activation, the user can begin the borrowing process by clicking on the **Borrow Now** button. The user will then be presented with a view containing a slider at the top, A dropdown menu in the middle section and a repayment method at the bottom.

If the user has any active loans that are yet to be repaid, an error will occur and the user will be asked to repay the current loan before borrowing again.
