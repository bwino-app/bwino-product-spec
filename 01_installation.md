# Installing the Bwino Application
At the moment, the application is only available for Android mobile phones and can be downloaded from [here](https://mage.365.ke/Bwino-Release-3.0.0.apk). After the application is downloaded, the user can go to the download location and install the application. The process is shown below.

## Allow Installation from Unknown Source
As the application was not downloaded from the Google Play Store, the user has to allow the installation from the local file storage by clicking `Settings`, followed by allowing installation from the relevant application.
